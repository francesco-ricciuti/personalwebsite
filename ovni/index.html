    <h1>OVNI</h1>
    
    <p>Hi Andreas!</p>
    
    <p>In your recent podcast with EU VC you mentioned you want to expand your team, so I thought I'd make things easy putting myself forward: can I be your right hand?</p>
    
    <h3>Why right hand and not investor?</h3>
    
    <p>I hate titles. Titles constrain what you do, and I like to do what's needed and not what my title says. For most of my career I didn't have titles anyway.</p>
    
    <p>You also do much more than investing: you have Prototype, you have the YouTube series, you do political activism. Each of these activities are part of the same umbrella and feed into the fund, and I'd love to help you on each one of them</p>
    
    <h3>Why me?</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>I can evaluate hard tech companies:</strong><br>
        I studied automation engineering, have built robots and made them autonomous. I speak the language of technical people because I'm one of them.</li>
        
        <li><strong>I can build healthy relationships with founders:</strong><br>
        I have worked at startups, I have started my (very unsuccessful) company, I have worked with several founders at Runa. I know how painful it is to be on that journey, and I will always be on the founders' side.</li>
        
        <li><strong>I have done political activism and loved it:</strong><br>
        I don't like to complain about things without trying to change them. I've been active on this front since high school, when I tried to be elected in the Student Council of my school. More recently, I have campaigned with the liberal party (the so-called "Terzo Polo" - a political project that now has miserably failed) during the 2022 presidential elections in Italy.</li>
        
        <li><strong>I have built a (very small, for now) online audience:</strong><br>
        I had tried unsuccessfully a couple of times with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/automataorg/?viewAsMember=true" target="_blank">Automata</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-lighthouse-today/about/?viewAsMember=true" target="_blank">The Lighthouse</a>. Now I'm blogging on <a href="https://unbeatenpath.substack.com/" target="_blank">Unbeaten Path</a> and have a small but engaged following.</li>
        
        <li><strong>I have invested in and worked with amazing founders at Runa:</strong><br>
        during these years I've invested in companies such as <a href="https://lacelithography.com/" target="_blank">Lace Lithography</a>, <a href="https://www.ubitium.com/" target="_blank">Ubitium</a>, <a href="https://microsignals.com/" target="_blank">Microsignals</a>, <a href="https://seechange.com/" target="_blank">Seechange</a>, <a href="https://enlightra.com/" target="_blank">Enlightra</a> and have supported <a href="https://www.welinq.fr/" target="_blank">Welinq</a>, <a href="https://qnami.ch/" target="_blank">Qnami</a>, <a href="https://lumai.ai/" target="_blank">Lumai</a>, <a href="https://www.akhetonics.com/" target="_blank">Akhetonics</a> and more.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Why you?</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>You're a solo GP:</strong><br>
        I believe there can't be certainty in early-stage investing, so having many decision makers is deletery in an early-stage fund. I like knowing who calls the shots, even if that person is not me.</li>
        
        <li><strong>You understand that community building is essential for venture investing:</strong><br>
        you are building a personal brand, and I love that. In an "AI-enhanced" world, brand and community are essential to win. You said: "it's fairly easy to see what good deals are, usually the hard part is hearing about them early enough and being able to have access to them", I agree and I think that you're building to optimize that.</li>
        
        <li><strong>You are trying to change the state of things in Europe:</strong><br>
        first time I ever heard of you is when you published <a href="https://klinger.io/posts/eu-acc" target="_blank">https://klinger.io/posts/eu-acc</a>. It was refreshing to see someone saying openly what I had been silently thinking for a while: <strong>We started to believe US propaganda about Europe</strong>. I want to help you in your effort to change things.</li>
        
        <li><strong>You believe in the power of storytelling:</strong><br>
        storytelling is very underrated when talking about startup ecosystems. You understand how important it is and are playing your role with your Youtube series.</li>
        
        <li><strong>You have been a founder:</strong><br>
        you know how painful it is. Hopefully you will remember about it when choosing on which side to be, and you will choose founders' side. I've worked with GPs that have never built anything, and I've seen how it reflects on their behaviors</li>
        
        <li><strong>You like hard tech:</strong><br>
        and so do I!</li>
